This issue has been split into two focused issues for better task management:

- #15 - Rendering Performance Optimizations (Graphics & Rendering Agent)
- #14 - Spatial Collision and Targeting Optimization (Core Gameplay Engineer)

Each issue can now be worked on independently by a single agent. Closing this in favor of the more focused issues.
