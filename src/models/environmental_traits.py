Environmental adaptation traits for creatures.

These traits allow creatures to better survive and thrive in different
environmental conditions (weather, terrain, time of day, hazards).

Integrates with:
- Existing trait system (src/models/trait.py)
- Environment system (src/models/environment.py)
- Ecosystem traits (src/models/ecosystem_traits.py)
- Genetics and breeding (src/systems/breeding.py)
